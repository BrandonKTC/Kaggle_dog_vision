## 1. Problem

Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

## 2. Data

The data we're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.

## 3. Evaluation

The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each image

## 4. Features

* we're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep leaning/transfer learning.
* There are 120 breeds of dogs
* There are 10, 000+ images in the training and the test set
